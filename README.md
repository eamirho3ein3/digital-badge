# 🔖 Digital Badge

**Digital Badge** is a fun and creative Flutter project I built on a train to London for the **Flutter London event**.  
Instead of wearing a boring paper name tag, I decided to make something more interactive — a **digital badge app** that displays my name, photo, and a QR code linking to my online profile.

## ✨ Features
- 🧑‍💻 Displays your **name** and **profile photo**  
- 🔗 Tap to show a **QR code** that links to:
  - Your **LinkedIn**
  - Your **portfolio website**
  - Your **GitHub**
  - Or any other personal link
